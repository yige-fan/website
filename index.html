      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Hi! I am in my first year as a PhD student, pursuing the Ph.D. degree in an interdisciplinary program at the School of Design, Shanghai Jiao Tong University. I previously received my M.S. in Industrial Design Engineering from SJTU and my B.S. in Mechanical Engineering from Hunan University.</p>
      <p>I aim to leverage design-driven innovation to influence human attitudes, emotions, and behaviors, creating physical objects based on theoretical insights to shape tangible interactions, foster richer, more meaningful real-world interactions in daily life.</p>
      <p>Currently, I focus on live streaming and social media as critical context, exploring to design a series of tangible interactive products to address the negative emotional and behavioral impacts of digital interactions, ultimately enhancing human well-being by reducing cognitive dissonance and attentional imbalance.</p>

      <h2>Projects</h2>
      <h3>Physical Environment and Light Interaction</h3>
      <p>This project is on the interaction between humans and their physical environments, particularly how natural light affects attitudes, emotions, and behaviors. In this area, I have developed AI-integrated, computationally driven programmable daylight regulation components through innovative participatory design processes, aiming to shape human-environment interactions while addressing aesthetic and comfort needs. </p>
      <p>As an extension of my work on human-environment interaction, I also contributed to a project exploring the design of 3D-printed components with fluidic tunable thermal conductivity for applications such as ice therapy wearables and containers.</p>

        <h3>Digital Environment and Social Interaction</h3>
      <p>The project is on human interactions in digital environments, particularly in the context of live streaming. I aim to optimize social performance and interface design through data-driven methods, enhancing user experience and promoting consumer behavior.</p>
      <p>This line of research is still ongoing</p>
